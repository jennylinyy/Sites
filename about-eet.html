          <p>The Epoch Times, published by The Epoch Times Association, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, is dedicated to seeking the truth through insightful and independent journalism.</p>
          <p>
          We stand outside of political interests and the pursuit of profit, to educate readers about today’s most critical issues with the intention of broadening minds and uplifting society. A well-informed society is the cornerstone of a flourishing democracy.</p>
          <p>
          Being independent, we investigate issues overlooked—or avoided—by other media outlets. We do this because we believe journalism must play the role of being truly responsible to society.</p>
          <p>
          We strive to highlight solutions and what’s good in society rather than the conflicts that divide us. We recognize the value of the traditional arts and their ability to inspire humankind towards its highest ideals.</p>
          <p>
          In our newsroom and our reporting, we are committed to being honest, respectful, and compassionate.</p>
          <p>
          We stand against the systematic destruction of traditional culture by destructive ideologies such as communism, which continues to harm societies around the world.</p>
          <p>
          We are inspired in this mission by our own experience. The Epoch Times was founded in 2000 to bring honest and uncensored news to people oppressed by the lies and violence of communism.</p>
          <p>
          Fulfilling this mission is our passion and our greatest honor.</p>
          <p>
          The Epoch Times provides award-winning newspapers and news platforms with the goal of being the global newspaper of record, with a positive influence on society. The Epoch Times provides critical in-depth analysis that has often been overlooked by other mainstream media outlets.</p>
          <p></p>

          <h4>Our History</h4>
          <p>Having witnessed events like Tiananmen Square and the persecution of the spiritual group Falun Gong, and at a great risk to themselves and their loved ones, a group of Chinese-Americans started publishing The Epoch Times in Chinese in May 2000 in New York City. Some reporters in China were jailed, and some suffered severe torture. Yet despite the risks, they could see the growing need for uncensored coverage of events in China.</p>
          <p>Local editions published by regional bureaus soon followed. Today it is the largest Chinese-language newspaper outside of Mainland China and Taiwan.
The English edition of The Epoch Times launched in September 2003 on the web, and in August 2004 as a newspaper in New York.</p>

          <h4>Our Reach</h4>
          <p>The English Epoch Times prints Monday-Friday in New York City and Washington, D.C., and weekly across the United States and Canada.</p>
          <p>In English, as well as in other languages, The Epoch Times serves a broad, international readership. We are proud to offer print and web editions in Chinese, English, Spanish, Hebrew, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, and Indonesian, as well as web versions in French, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Ukrainian, Russian, Romanian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Turkish, Bulgarian, and Persian.</p>
